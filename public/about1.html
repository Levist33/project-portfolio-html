<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Hey there! I'm the kind of developer who believes code is more than logic—it's language, art, and a little bit of magic.</p>


<p>From building systems that hum in harmony to chasing down bugs like a digital detective, I thrive on curiosity and clean design. I love turning ideas into intuitive user experiences, and I'm not afraid to dive deep into documentation (yes, really).
</p>
<p>Outside the keyboard world, you’ll find me exploring new tech, sipping coffee like it's source code fuel, or pretending I'm not thinking about side projects on weekends.</p>


<p>This code is a small slice of who I am—crafted with intention, a touch of nerdiness, and a whole lot of love for what I do.
